# Claude Code SDLC Wizard

A **self-evolving Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) enforcement system for AI coding agents**. Makes Claude plan before coding, test before shipping, and ask when uncertain. Measures itself getting better over time.

**Built on 15+ years of software engineering and founding engineering experience** — battle-tested patterns from real production systems, baked into an AI agent that follows tried-and-true software quality practices so you don't have to enforce them manually.

## Install

**Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)** (Anthropic's CLI for Claude).

Run from your terminal or from inside Claude Code (`!` prefix):
```bash
npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init
```
Then start (or restart) Claude Code — type `/exit` then `claude` to reload hooks. Setup auto-invokes on first prompt — Claude reads the wizard doc, scans your project, and generates bespoke CLAUDE.md, SDLC.md, TESTING.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md. No manual commands needed.

<summary>Alternative install methods</summary>

**curl (no npm install needed):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-wizard/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install BaseInfinity/sdlc-wizard/sdlc-wizard
sdlc-wizard init
```

**GitHub CLI extension:**
```bash
gh extension install BaseInfinity/gh-sdlc-wizard
gh sdlc-wizard init
```

**From GitHub (no npm registry needed):**
```bash
npx github:BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-wizard init
```

**Install CLI globally:**
```bash
npm install -g agentic-sdlc-wizard
sdlc-wizard init
```

**Manual (advanced — escape hatch only):** Download `CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md` to your project and tell Claude `Run the SDLC wizard setup`. This skips the live-session auto-invoke and is only intended for environments where `npx`, `curl`, `brew`, and `gh` are all unavailable. The default human path is `npx init` → restart CC → first-prompt auto-setup, not this manual flow.

<summary>Health check & updates</summary>

```bash
npx agentic-sdlc-wizard check        # Human-readable
npx agentic-sdlc-wizard check --json  # Machine-readable (CI-friendly)
```

Reports MATCH / CUSTOMIZED / MISSING / DRIFT for every installed file. Exits non-zero on MISSING or DRIFT — use in CI to catch setup regressions.

**Check for content updates:** Tell Claude `Check if the SDLC wizard has updates` — it reads [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), shows what's new, and offers to apply changes.

## Why Use This

You want Claude Code to follow engineering discipline automatically:
- **Plan before coding** (not guess-and-check)
- **Write tests first** (TDD enforced via hooks)
- **State confidence** (LOW = ask user, don't guess)
- **Track work visibly** (TaskCreate)
- **Self-review before presenting**
- **Prove it's better** (use native features unless you prove custom wins)

The wizard auto-detects your stack (package.json, test framework, deployment targets) and generates bespoke hooks + skills + docs. CI validates the generated assets; cross-stack setup-path E2E is on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## What This Actually Is

Five layers working together:

```
Layer 5: SELF-IMPROVEMENT
  Weekly/monthly workflows detect changes, test them
  statistically, create PRs. Baselines evolve organically.

Layer 4: STATISTICAL VALIDATION
  E2E scoring with 95% CI (5 trials, t-distribution).
  SDP normalizes for model quality. CUSUM catches drift.

Layer 3: SCORING ENGINE
  Multi-criteria scoring, 10/11 points. Claude evaluates Claude.
  Before/after wizard A/B comparison in CI.

Layer 2: ENFORCEMENT
  Hooks fire every interaction (~100 tokens).
  PreToolUse reminds Claude to write tests first.

Layer 1: PHILOSOPHY
  The wizard document. KISS. TDD. Confidence levels.
  Copy it, run setup, get a bespoke SDLC.
```

## What Makes This Different

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **E2E scoring in CI** | Every PR gets an automated SDLC compliance score (0-10) — measures whether Claude actually planned, tested, and reviewed |
| **Before/after A/B testing** | Compares wizard changes against a baseline with 95% confidence intervals to prove improvements aren't noise |
| **SDP normalization** | Separates "the model had a bad day" from "our SDLC broke" by cross-referencing external benchmarks |
| **CUSUM drift detection** | Catches gradual quality decay over time — borrowed from manufacturing quality control |
| **Pre-tool TDD hooks** | Before source edits, a hook reminds Claude to write tests first. CI scoring checks whether it actually followed TDD |
| **Self-evolving loop** | Weekly/monthly external research + local CI shepherd loop — you approve, the system gets better |

## Optional: Cross-Model Review (Codex)

Claude can't grade its own homework. Have a **different AI from a different company** review Claude's work — different training, different blind spots, different biases. We use OpenAI's Codex CLI, and it's **three commands to set up**:

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
codex --version   # confirm ready
```

That's it. Codex picks up your OpenAI account's best available model automatically — **if you have GPT-5.5, it uses GPT-5.5; otherwise GPT-5.4**. No model config needed.

**How to use it:** after Claude's self-review passes, write a one-file mission brief and run:

```bash
codex exec -c 'model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"' -s danger-full-access \
  -o .reviews/latest-review.md \
  "Read .reviews/handoff.json and review per the checklist. Output findings + CERTIFIED or NOT CERTIFIED."
```

`xhigh` reasoning is **non-negotiable** — lower settings miss subtle bugs. See [CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md](CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md#cross-model-review-loop-optional) for the full protocol (handoff format, round-2 dialogue loop, preflight docs). Real-world: this catches P0/P1 issues in 2-3 out of 10 reviews that Claude's self-review rated as clean.

## How It Works

**Think Iron Man:** Jarvis is nothing without Tony Stark. Tony Stark is still Tony Stark. But together? They make Iron Man. This SDLC is your suit - you build it over time, improve it for your needs, and it makes you both better.

**The dream:** Mold an ever-evolving SDLC to your needs. Replace my components with native Claude Code features as they ship — and one day, delete this repo entirely because Claude Code has them all built in. That's the goal.

## Self-Evolving System

| Cadence | Source | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Weekly | Claude Code releases | PR with analysis + E2E test |
| Weekly | Community (Reddit, HN) | Issue digest |
| Monthly | Deep research, papers | Trend report |

Every update: regression tested -> AI reviewed -> human approved.

## E2E Scoring

Like evaluating scientific method adherence - we measure **process compliance**:

| Criterion | Points | Type |
|-----------|--------|------|
| TodoWrite/TaskCreate | 1 | Deterministic |
| Confidence stated | 1 | Deterministic |
| Plan mode | 2 | AI-judge |
| TDD RED | 2 | Deterministic |
| TDD GREEN | 2 | AI-judge |
| Self-review | 1 | AI-judge |
| Clean code | 1 | AI-judge |

40% deterministic + 60% AI-judged. 5 trials handle variance.

## Model-Adjusted Scoring (SDP)

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Raw** | Actual score (Layer 2: SDLC compliance) |
| **SDP** | Adjusted for model conditions |
| **Robustness** | How well SDLC holds up vs model changes |

- **Robustness < 1.0** = SDLC is resilient (good!)
- **Robustness > 1.0** = SDLC is sensitive (investigate)

## Tests Are The Building Blocks

Tests aren't just validation - they're the foundation everything else builds on.

- **Tests >= App Code** - Critique tests as hard (or harder) than implementation
- **Tests prove correctness** - Without them, you're just hoping
- **Tests enable fearless change** - Refactor confidently

## Official Plugin Integration

| Plugin | Purpose | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `claude-md-management` | **Required** - CLAUDE.md maintenance | CLAUDE.md only |
| `claude-code-setup` | Recommends automations | Recommendations |
| `code-review` | Local self-review and PR review (optional) | Local + PRs |

## Prove It's Better

Don't reinvent the wheel. Use native/built-in features UNLESS you prove your custom version is better. If you can't prove it, delete yours.

1. Test the native solution — measure quality, speed, reliability
2. Test your custom solution — same scenario, same metrics
3. Compare side-by-side
4. Native >= custom? **Use native. Delete yours.**
5. Custom > native? **Keep yours. Document WHY.** Re-evaluate when native improves.

This applies to everything: native commands vs custom skills, framework utilities vs hand-rolled code, library functions vs custom implementations.

## How This Compares

This isn't the only Claude Code SDLC tool. Here's an honest comparison:

| Aspect | SDLC Wizard | everything-claude-code | claude-sdlc |
|--------|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | SDLC enforcement + measurement | Agent performance optimization | Plugin marketplace |
| **Hooks** | 3 (SDLC, TDD, instructions) | 12+ (dev blocker, prettier, etc.) | Webhook watcher |
| **Skills** | 4 (/sdlc, /setup, /update, /feedback) | 80+ domain-specific | 13 slash commands |
| **Evaluation** | 95% CI, CUSUM, SDP, Tier 1/2 | Configuration testing | skilltest framework |
| **CI Shepherd** | Local CI fix loop | No | No |
| **Auto-updates** | Weekly CC + community scan | No | No |
| **Install** | `npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init` | npm install | npm install |
| **Philosophy** | Lightweight, prove-it-or-delete | Scale and optimization | Documentation-first |

**Our unique strengths:** Statistical rigor (CUSUM + 95% CI), SDP scoring (model quality vs SDLC compliance), CI shepherd loop, Prove-It A/B pipeline, comprehensive automated test suite, dogfooding enforcement.

**Where others are stronger:** everything-claude-code has broader language/framework coverage. claude-sdlc has webhook-driven automation. Both have npm distribution.

**The spirit:** Open source — we learn from each other. See [COMPETITIVE_AUDIT.md](COMPETITIVE_AUDIT.md) for details.
