# Quality test: pr-review.yml skips Claude PR review on the wizard's own self-PRs.
#
# The `review` job runs claude-code-action@v1 which requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# with a positive credit balance. The wizard maintainer runs an "API canary" —
# keeping the credit balance dead so unexpected API draws are detected. That
# means the review job has been failing on every wizard self-PR with
# "Credit balance is too low".
#
# The wizard uses Codex for cross-model review on its own PRs (see SDLC skill),
# so the Claude PR review is redundant on self-repo. Consumers using pr-review.yml
# in their own projects benefit from the Claude PR review and SHOULD have it run.
#
# Fix: skip the review job when the workflow runs in BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-wizard.
# Consumers' forks/copies of pr-review.yml run normally.
#
# Lessons learned (from 7 self-PRs merged with red review job in v1.39.0–v1.42.0):
# - Red CI normalizes red — a NEW review failure (e.g., real bug detected) would
#   look identical to the canary failure and be missed.
# - "Required check is green so I can merge" is not the same as "all checks green".
# - SDLC: ALL TESTS MUST PASS BEFORE COMMIT — no exceptions, including non-required.
