# Regression tests for scripts/persist-score-history.sh
#
# Root cause this protects against (observed 2026-04-18 on PR #194 CI):
#   The "Persist scores to PR branch" step in ci.yml appends a score
#   commit and pushes `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`. When main advances
#   during CI and the PR branch gets a new commit from a concurrent
#   scorer (or a rebase), the push is rejected as non-fast-forward:
#
#     ! [rejected]        HEAD -> <branch> (fetch first)
#     error: failed to push some refs
#
#   The step was marked `continue-on-error: true`, so the failure was
#   silent. The append never landed on the PR branch, never got
#   squash-merged into main, and score-history.jsonl stayed stale for
#   19+ days even though the evaluator ran and produced valid scores.
#
# This test drives `scripts/persist-score-history.sh` which MUST
# fetch-rebase-retry on non-fast-forward rejection instead of giving up.
