# Testing Strategy

## The Absolute Rule

```
ALL TESTS MUST PASS. NO EXCEPTIONS.

This is not negotiable. This is not flexible. This is absolute.
```

**Not acceptable excuses:**
- "Those tests were already failing" -> Then fix them first
- "That's not related to my changes" -> Doesn't matter, fix it
- "It's flaky, just ignore it" -> Flaky = bug, investigate it
- "It passes locally" -> CI is the source of truth

**The process:**
1. Tests fail -> STOP
2. Investigate -> Find root cause
3. Fix -> Whatever is actually broken
4. All tests pass -> THEN commit

## Meta-Testing Challenge

This is a **meta-project** - it's a wizard that sets up other projects. Traditional testing doesn't directly apply.

| Normal Project | This Project |
|----------------|--------------|
| Test source code | Test wizard installation |
| Unit test functions | Test script logic |
| Integration test APIs | Test workflow behavior |
| E2E test user flows | Simulate wizard usage |

## Test Files

### Layer 1: Script Logic Tests

| Test File | Tests | What It Covers |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `tests/test-version-logic.sh` | Version comparison | Semver parsing, upgrade detection |

| `tests/test-autocompact-benchmark.sh` | Autocompact benchmarking | Methodology rigor, harness quality, task suite, canary facts, CI workflow |
| `tests/test-node24-compliance.sh` | Node 24 compliance | No deprecated node20 actions, correct versions, no node-version: 20 |
| `tests/test-effectiveness-scoreboard.sh` | Effectiveness scoreboard | Seed data quality, DDE calculation, escape rate, analytics output |
| `tests/test-firmware-fixture.sh` | Firmware fixture | Domain indicators, Python overlay, test infra, multi-device, no-web negative test |
| `tests/test-model-comparison.sh` | Model comparison benchmark | Workflow structure, model parameterization, error handling, cost controls |
| `tests/test-degradation-detection.sh` | Degradation detection | Score persistence, fork guard, wizard hardening, anti-laziness mechanisms |

**How to run:**
```bash
./tests/test-version-logic.sh
./tests/test-analysis-schema.sh
./tests/test-workflow-triggers.sh
./tests/test-cusum.sh
./tests/test-stats.sh
./tests/test-hooks.sh
./tests/test-compliance.sh
./tests/test-evaluate-bugs.sh
./tests/test-score-analytics.sh
./tests/test-domain-detection.sh
./tests/test-autocompact-benchmark.sh
./tests/test-node24-compliance.sh
./tests/test-firmware-fixture.sh
./tests/test-model-comparison.sh
```

### Layer 2: Fixture Validation

**Location**: `tests/fixtures/releases/`

**What they test**:
- Analysis response format
- Relevance categorization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Required JSON fields present

### Layer 3: E2E Simulation

**Location**: `tests/e2e/`

**What it tests**:
- Wizard installation on test repo
- SDLC compliance during tasks
- Hook firing behavior
- Scoring criteria (10 checks across 7 categories, up to 11 points on UI scenarios)

**How to run:**
```bash
# Validation only (no API key needed)
./tests/e2e/run-simulation.sh

# Full simulation (requires Claude Code CLI + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx ./tests/e2e/run-simulation.sh
```

### Layer 4: SDP / Statistical Validation

| Test File | Tests | What It Covers |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `tests/test-sdp-calculation.sh` | SDP scoring | Raw/adjusted, caps, robustness, interpretations |
| `tests/test-external-benchmark.sh` | External benchmarks | Source fallback, caching, model mapping |

These validate the model-adjusted scoring that distinguishes "model issues" from "wizard issues".

**How to run:**
```bash
./tests/test-sdp-calculation.sh
./tests/test-external-benchmark.sh
```

./tests/e2e/test-pairwise-compare.sh
./tests/e2e/test-scenario-rotation.sh
./tests/e2e/test-simulation-prompt.sh
```

## CI Integration

Tests run automatically on:
- Every pull request
- Push to main branch

CI runs:
1. YAML validation
2. Shell script checks
3. Prompt file validation
4. State file validation
5. All Layer 1 script tests
6. E2E fixture validation (Layer 3)
7. E2E quick check (Tier 1, 1x run)
8. E2E full evaluation (Tier 2, 5x runs, on `merge-ready` label)

## Manual Testing

Workflows require the GitHub Actions environment (secrets, runner context, `claude-code-action@v1`). They cannot be tested locally with `act`.

**What you can test locally:**
```bash
# YAML syntax validation
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"

# All script-based tests (no API key needed)
./tests/test-version-logic.sh && ./tests/test-analysis-schema.sh

# E2E simulation (requires Claude Code CLI + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx ./tests/e2e/run-simulation.sh
```

## Playwright MCP vs Playwright Tests

**They are different tools for different jobs. Don't confuse them.**

| | Playwright MCP (debugging) | Playwright Test Framework (automation) |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | MCP server Claude uses to interact with a live browser | Automated test runner (`npx playwright test`) |
| **When** | Debugging a visual issue, inspecting DOM state, verifying a fix looks right | Regression testing on every PR, CI gating |
| **Who runs it** | Claude (via MCP tool calls during a conversation) | CI pipeline (headless, no human) |
| **Repeatable** | No — interactive, exploratory, one-off | Yes — deterministic, runs the same every time |
| **Replaces** | A human opening DevTools to inspect the page | Nothing — this IS the automated test layer |

**Playwright MCP replaces a human doing visual testing.** Instead of you opening a browser, clicking around, and eyeballing whether things look right — Claude does it. For any web project, this is huge:
- "Does this CSS change actually look right?" — Claude screenshots it and tells you
- "Is the modal centered on mobile?" — Claude resizes the viewport and checks
- "Click through the checkout flow and tell me what breaks" — Claude does it like a QA tester would
- "What's the DOM state after this interaction?" — Claude inspects it like DevTools

**It does NOT replace `npx playwright test`.** Automated browser regression tests must:
- Run headless in CI on every PR
- Cover critical user flows (login, checkout, form submission)
- Catch regressions without human intervention
- Produce deterministic pass/fail results

**The rule:** Use Playwright MCP to debug and verify during development. Use Playwright tests to prevent regressions in CI. If someone tells you "we have Playwright MCP so we don't need E2E tests" — that's like saying "I have Chrome DevTools so I don't need a test suite."

## Known Gaps

### Cannot Fully Test in CI
- Real interactive hook firing inside live user sessions
- PR/issue creation side effects (requires repo permissions)

### What CI Does Test
- Script-level tests use fixtures (no API key needed)
- E2E quick-check and full-evaluation run real Claude API simulations on PRs
- Structure, logic, and scoring validation on every push
